  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements (REQ-22, REQ-23, REQ-24) for fixing admin login authentication. Backend validates credentials correctly, frontend properly sends credentials and handles responses, and comprehensive console logging has been added throughout the authentication flow. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",

    {
      "description": "Admin role assignment during login process",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states as a non-goal: 'Changing admin credentials from admin/admin123' and 'Implementing new authentication methods beyond username/password'. However, the implementation adds role assignment functionality (assignCallerUserRole and assignUserRole methods) which was not requested in any of the three requirements. REQ-22 only requires validation, token/session generation, and return to frontend - not role assignment logic.",
