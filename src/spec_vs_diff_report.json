  "summary": "The diff implements all requirements for the client inquiry form update. The backend endpoint accepts all 9 parameters and stores inquiries. The frontend ContactSection includes all 9 specified fields with proper types (textarea for Features/Requirements and Additional Notes, date input for Deadline, dropdown for Website Type with the four options). The React Query hook useSubmitInquiry follows existing patterns and is integrated with the form. The old 'Message' field has been removed. Loading states, success feedback, error handling, and form reset are implemented. The design maintains coral/charcoal colors and responsive styling with smooth transitions.",
