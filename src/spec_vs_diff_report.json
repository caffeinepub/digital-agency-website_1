  "summary": "The diff shows frontend-only changes updating React components to integrate with a Motoko backend, including authentication flows, user queries, and inquiry management. However, the backend/main.mo file itself is not present in the diff, making it impossible to verify if REQ-18 (Motoko backend implementation) was actually completed. The frontend changes appear to support the required Motoko integration patterns (REQ-19), and branding/design preservation (REQ-20) is evidenced in Layout.tsx. No dfx.json or deployment configuration is visible in the diff (REQ-21).",

      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Migrate the backend from Express/Node.js to Motoko architecture, preserving all existing authentication logic, user profile management, role-based access control (admin/user), and inquiry submission endpoints",
      "reason": "The diff does not include backend/main.mo or any Motoko backend files. While frontend hooks reference Motoko actor methods (login, submitInquiry, getCallerRole, etc.), there is no evidence that the Motoko backend itself was created or that it implements the required functionality.",

      "requirement": "Configure the project for Internet Computer deployment with proper canister configuration, ensuring the application can be deployed and accessible via ic0.app domain",
      "reason": "No dfx.json configuration file is present in the diff. Without this file, backend and frontend canisters cannot be defined, and Internet Computer deployment cannot be configured.",
